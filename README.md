Notes on running the game:
You need to add the scenes to your build. Go to File->Build Settings-> and drag the 3 Scenes into the "Scenes in Build" box
When you run the game, you need to run it from the "Menu" scene.
The Quit button will not work in Unity but if you built the app outside of Unity the program would shut down.
